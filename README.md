## Notes
The OMDB project is the first large project in the Plataforma 5 coding bootcamp curriculum. After one and half months of workshops and small pair-programming projects we are assigned to individually make a simple IMDB clone within 1 week. I really enjoyed being able dive in deeper into all the concepts I had been studying. Throughout the bootcamp we mostly used PostgreSQL and Sequelize for a backend and were encouraged to continue using them for this project, but if we desired were allowed to choose any type of database. I choose to challenge myself by learning and using MongoDB since I was very interested in learning about noSQL databases. For this project I was goal oriented and spent most the time achieving the objectives. In this way the app functions well, but the styling and design leave a lot to be desired. During the week I managed to implement all the requisites except being able to view other users' favorite films. Since I put myself the additional challenge of learning a new type of database, I am very satisfied with the final result even though I missed one objective. To see the complete project guidelines look at projectREADME.md (Note: As the bootcamp was given in Argentina the guidlines are written in Spanish)   

## Future improvements
* Styling and User Experience
* Adding feature to view other user profiles and their favorited films.
